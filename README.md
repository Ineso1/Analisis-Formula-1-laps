# Analisis-Formula-1-laps
It is intended to analyze the maximum speeds in formula 1 track curves adjusted to polynomial equations, in order to solve a proposal for the positioning of stands to reduce the risk of the spectator.

Whe can manipulate the principal data, like the ecuation of the curves, cant angle, coefficient of friction, velocity, etc.
We can apreciate an animation of the kart at some velocity and see were the criticals points are
Finally we get the optimal proposal
